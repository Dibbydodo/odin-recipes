        <li>1/4 cup (35g) black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>31/2 tsp black salt</li>
        <li>2 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>600g good-quality beef eye fillet, trimmed</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Horseradish Creme Fraiche</strong>
    <uL>
        <li>250g creme fraiche</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (45g) finely chopped cornichons</li>
        <li>1 eschalot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbs bottled horseradish</li>
    </uL>
    <p>
        <strong>Method</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the yeast, sugar and 1 cup (250ml) lukewarm water in a bowl, stirring to dissolve the yeast. Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside in a warm place for 10 minutes or until frothy.</li>
        <li>Combine the flour, sesame seeds and 1 tsp black salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Add the yeast mixture and 1 tbs oil and stir until combined.</li>
        <li>Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth. Place dough in a large oiled bowl. Cover with a tea towel and set aside in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rub the beef with the remaining 1 tbs oil. Heat a frypan over high heat and cook the beef for 1 minute on each side until browned. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, tying a knot at either end, then freeze for 1 hour to firm slightly.</li>
        <li>For the horseradish creme fraiche, place all the ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine. Chill until ready to serve. Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease and line 3 large baking trays with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Stretch and roll 1 heaped tablespoon of dough on a work surface until 5mm-1cm thick. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Place grissini on the prepared trays and scatter with 1 teaspoon salt. Bake for 20 minutes or until crisp. Set aside to cool on the trays.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the wrapped beef as thinly as possible, then arrange on a large chilled serving platter.</li>
        <li>Rub the remaining salt and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl, then sprinkle over the beef. Serve the grissini with beef carpaccio and horseradish creme fraiche.</li>
